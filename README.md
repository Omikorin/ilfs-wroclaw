# ILFS Day Website Template

Same template for all local ILFS Days? No way! 

## Idea

The website is simple and doesn't require any build tool.
It is a complete, single HTML file.
It uses Pico CSS as a non-bloated option for any CSS library.

There are some things you may or may not like depending on your strategy:
- Call For Papers - submitting talk ideas in advance
- Registration - I recommend this to have a real number of attendees in mind.
- Team - from what I know, people like to see people on company and organization websites. We want to show people from FOSS, we are FOSS too, so let's show who is behind your local event :) 

Feel free to remove any boilerplate info and change it as you like.

## Setup

First things first, click on "Use this template" next to the star button (consider giving a star!).

This repository doesn't require any knowledge.
The only thing you have to do is replace the `index.html` file with one of your own language from the `i18n` directory under the same name.

The next step is to add your own information about the event and remove unnecessary sections.

The easiest way to host your site is to use GitHub Pages, Codeberg Pages, or Cloudflare Pages.

## Contributing

The site is probably 100% done, but we can consider not groundbreaking fixes to its design.

If you speak a language that doesn't have its own translation here, please help!
Translate the original content of `index.html` into your own language. Let's keep the translations concise. Later you can make a fork where you can customize it to your liking.
